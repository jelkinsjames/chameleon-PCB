# TODO: finish bill of materials

### Inputs (mono only):
Inputs can have a voltage from [0, 2.1Vrms] in single mode and [0, 4.2Vrms] in differential mode. We are using our device in differential mode.

The chip has two primary ADCs that can be used for stereo audio (for a total of four mono inputs). The chip has a secondary ADC that can be used for low power voltage monitoring and interrupts which we are not using.

The chip can support up to two microphones (analog or digital). Analog inputs are directed through Vin while digital microphones are directed through GPIO. We are not using microphones.

The chip supports two digital microphones using GPIO1 as data input and GPIO2 as a clock. The recommended clock frequency is 2.8224MHz (44.1kHz * 64). The recommended sampling frequency is 44.1kHz where SCK is 256 * the sampling frequency. We are leaving the auto clock detector enabled for digital microphones.

The suggested hardware for single-ended inputs is:

Place film-type capacitors of 0.01 µF as close as possible to the VINLx and VINRx pins, and terminate to GND as close as possible to the AGND pin in order to maximize the dynamic performance of ADC. To maintain common-mode rejection, match the series resistors as closely as possible. The suggested hardware for single-ended inputs instead of microphones is:

![](/images/single-ended.png)

Microphone bias can power electret microphones. Input 2.6V to pin 5 (MIC BIAS). Decouple and filter the power. An on-chip terminating resistor (to GND) can be enabled by writing to the *MIC_BIAS_CTRL (0x15)* register. The default is to bypass the onboard terminating resistor. We are going to use the terminating resistor.

DC blocking capacitors are used for all analog input signals. The pins are biased to a Vref of AVDD / 2. *Do not connect unused analog input pins.*

For single-ended analog inputs, use MD2, MD5, MD6. For setting the device to follower mode, use MD0 and MD1.

Types of inputs:
- Control voltage (CV) at 5V stepped down.
- 3.5mm Headphone jack.
- Guitar or bass (through adapter into a 3.5mm jack)

## Outputs:
- Digital I2S signal
- Other configurable outputs are not used for our project.
- GPIO pins have their polarities reversed

## Hardware control configurations:
- **To set to I2C mode:** Set MD0 low.
- **To set hardware address:** Set MDO1 low for I2C address: 0x94. Set MDO1 High for I2C address: 0x96.

The power-up sequence consists of the following steps:
1. Power-on reset
(a) Power up AVDD, DVDD and IOVDD
(b) Check if LDO is being driven with an external 1.8 V, or is an output. Enable LDO if required.
(c) Release digital reset
2. Wait until analog voltage reference is stable
3. Configure clock (PLL requires < 250 µs)
4. Fade-in audio ADC content

## Basic device configuration:
- The device by default starts in follower mode at 48 kHz
- Set global loss level to be –50 dB using the DSP coefficient method.
- Configure active mode
# TODO: how to configure active mode?
- Set Read Data without latch in register AUXADC_DATA_CTRL (0x58)
- Set interrupts (energysense and controlsense) using INT_EN (0x60)
- Set interrupt pulse for 3 ms (makes it easier to see it visually using INT_PLS (0x62))

## Update system settings:
- Read interrupt status INT_STAT register(0x61)
- Clear interrupt enable INT_EN (0x60)
- Check which input caused the interrupt; in this case, looking for (4R) SIGDET_STAT (0x32)
- Read new 4R data (for example, SIGDET_DC_LEVEL_CH4_R 0x57).
- Set SIGDET_DC_REF_CH4_R (0x55) to be the new value.
- Now that interrupt source is removed, we can clear the SIGDET_STAT register (0x32)
- Write 0xFF to SIGDET_STAT register (0x32).
- Write 0x00 to SIGDET_STAT register (0x32).
- Re-enable control Sense Interrupt in INT_EN (0x60)


## I2C communication:
- **SDA:** Pin 23, I/O I2C data.
- **SCL:** Pin 24, input I2C clock.
- **AD:** Pin 25, input I2C address 1.

- *MST_MODE (0x20):* Set high to select follower I2C mode.

7-bit follower address. The first 6 (MSB) bits of the address are factory set to **1001 01**. The final bit is set by the address pin (AD).

I2C status: The status of I2C can be read from register 0x72 through 0x75 and 0x78. Sample rate, power rail status, clock error, and clock ratios can be read from the status registers.

## Clocking:
**In follower mode, all clocks must be supplied externally.** The chip's master clock (MCK) must be of the form 2^n power of the sampling frequency. The chip's bit clock (BCK) should be running at 64 * sampling frequency. The word clock (left-right clock, LLRCK) determines the sampling point for the ADC. The chip must have its phase lock loop (PLL) programmed to generate audio clocks, but any incoming clock in the range [1MHz, 50MHz] will work.
- 12MHz clock is recommended for 44.1kHz sampling
- 192kHz sampling is only supported if using a CMOS oscillator (we are not using)
- DSP1 and DSP2 should be 256 * sampling frequency

# Registers:
The registers are split into two usable pages. Page 0 deals with device configuration and page 1 indirectly program coefficients for two fixed DSPs. Page 0 is the focus of this project. Change pages by writing to register 0x00 with the desired page number. Reset registers by writing 0xFE to register 0x00. Page 235 deals with registers that should not be edited, so we will not discuss them.

- 0x01: channel 1L gain. What do we want?
- 0x05: clipping and gain. set gain to all be the same: 11100110
- 0x0b: i2s receive: 00000000. 32 bit word length for single ended and stereo. LRCK 50% duty cycle. I2S format.
- 0x0d: serial data offset: 00000001. setting offset to be i2s.
- 0x0e: serial data offset: 00000001. setting offset to be i2s.
- 0x0f: i have no idea what this means.
- 0x10: GPIO 0-1 control: 00000101. DOUT2 is GPIO0.
- 0x12: GPIO 0-1 direction: 00000100. set GPIO0 as output.
- 0x1a: digital mic. 01010000. set mics to GPIO1 not GPIO0.
- 0x20: clocks. 01010001. use SCK in master mode.
- 0x72: read device status. run mode is 00001111 and power down is 00000000
- 0x73: read current sampling freq: how to lower to 44.1kHz?
- 0x78: read power status






### Input Selection:
Inputs can be mixed using the ADC input selection register *ADCX1_INPUT_SEL_X (0x06 --> 0x09).* Mixing left and right sources to create mono mixes can only be done in the digital mixer, post ADC conversion, or alternatively, other analog inputs can be connected for mixing. Here is a table describing possible mixes. [SE] represents single-ended where [DIFF] represents a differential input.

**ADCX1_INPUT_SEL_X:**
![ADCX1_INPUT_SEL_X](/images/muxmix.png)


### Channel Linking:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Stereo inputs should be linked and tracked across input channels.
![](/images/linking.png)
# TODO: do we want linking for our mono inputs?
=======
Stereo inputs should be linked and tracked across input channels. We are not using stereo audio, so we are not linking.

### Clock sources:
- *CLK_MODE (0x20):* Clock selection. Bits [5:7] configure the OR and MUX for the master clock (MCLK).
- *MST_MODE (0x20):* Set master or follower mode. Bits [1:3] sets clock sources for ADC, DSP1, and DSP2. *We ignore these, and use the default settings.*
- *MST_SCK_SRC (0x20):* Sets the source of the SCKO in master mode. *We are using the chip in follower mode, so we are ignoring this register.*
- *CLKDET_EN (0x20):* **Set the auto clock detector bit to true. This step is important!**
- PLL configuration: registers 0x28 --> 0x2D
![](/images/pllregisters.png)
- *CLK_ERR_STAT (0x75):* Status of halt and error detector. Error detector is high if there is an unexpected ratio of BCK to LRCK. If an error is detected, the chip is put into standby mode.
- *AUXADC_DATA_CTRL (0x58):* Checks the DC detector as part of the *energysense* and *controlsense*.
- *SEC_ADC_INPUT_SEL (0x0A):* Scanning for thresholds and interrupts in active mode (autodetects in sleep mode). The chip does not auto switch from sleep to wake mode.

### Sense:
We are not using the chip in sleep mode. We will always have the chip in active mode.
- *DSP_CTRL (0x71):* Allows you to choose between FIR response and low-latency IIR response. The high pass filter to remove DC bias is enabled by default.

### Audio Format Selection:
Pin MD4 to select between left justified and I2S.
- *I2S_FMT (0x0B):* Choose between, left justified, right justified, time division multiplexed, and I2S. We are selecting I2S.
- *GPIO1_FUNC (0x10):* Enables second **DOUT** through GPIO1.

# PCB Creation:
Our ADC board centers around the PCM1863, but contains other peripherals. This section will discuss the design decisions for the PCM1863 and peripherals.

Ti recommended PCB practices are:
- Separate analog and digital sections where layout permits. Route analog lines away from digital lines. This routing technique prevents digital noise from coupling back into analog signals.
- The bottom copper plane can be a shared ground, whereas a ground plane can be used on the top layer as well. Separated planes for analog and digital grounds are not required to achieve data sheet performance.
- Place decoupling capacitors as close as possible to the supply pins, and in the same layer of the device, to yield the best results. Do not place vias between decoupling capacitors and the device.
- Place ground planes between the input traces to achieve the lowest crosstalk performance.

The PCM1863 has 30 pins. ![](/images/pcmpinout.png)

**Of the 30 pins, 12 are analog and 18 are digital.** The chip is split into a digital and an analog part so the noisy digital powers and signals do not interfere with the sensitive analog signals.

# TODO: can we do 44.1kHz sampling?
![](/images/plltimings.png)

---

### PLL Information:
The PLL is enabled by default to clock the fast DSPs.
- **PLLCK = (PLLCKIN * R * JD) / P**
- **PLLCK = (PLLCKIN * R * K) / P**

Where:
- R, J, D, and P are register programmable values
- **J:** is the integer part of K
- **D:** is the fractional part of K to *four digits of precision*

![](/images/pllexamples.png)

### Clock error procedure:
When a clock error is detected, the chip goes into standby mode. The steps are as follows:
- Mute audio output immediately (no ramp down)
- Wait until proper clock ratio returns (*Clock Waiting State*)
- Restart clock detection, PLL, and clock dividers
- Start output fade in

![](/images/clkerrorlogic.png)
![](/images/clkerrorlogic2.png)

Clock error detection can be ignored by disabling *CLKDET_EN*.

### Secondary ADC:
We are always using the chip in active mode, so the secondary ADC is not used in wake functions.

### DSPs:
DSP1 and DSP2 are fixed function processors. DSPs can be programmed by targeting their memory address.

## Inputs:
Line out from a 3.5mm jack:
- 1mW to a 600ohm load
- 0.77Vrms or 2.2Vpp with 1.3mArms or 3.6mApp

Should use an oscilloscope to measure the voltage doming from the jack. Voltage is 2mVbw to 20mVrms. Suggested gain is 20dB. Direct instruments can produce over 2Vrms.

Need a circuit to filter. Can use a capacitive op amp. Can use RC for cutoff. Can pre-amplify with op amp.

Control voltage: [-12V, 12V] for CV, [-3V, 8V] for Midi if C3 = 0V. Voltage needs to be shifted up 2.5V for input control voltages if only desiring positive aspects (for resonance) to [0V, 2.5V].

Include protection diodes to prevent the voltage going over +12V/-12V!
- CV: Control voltage. Need a GATE signal to activate the CV, any voltage over 3V will work [3V, 12v].
- VCF: Voltage filter.
- VCO: Voltage oscillator.

Control voltage:
- 12 notes for each voltage. Either AC <20Hz or DC. Trigger signals are 3-4ms. Gate signals are 25-35ms. Audio should be in the range of 20Hz-20,000Hz.
- Input should have an impedance of 100kOhms - should be done through a filter.

Midi uses A-100 system bus. Needs to handle at most +12V/2A, -12V/1.2A, +5V/4A.
